//Flower cultists have been attacking islands along King Meek's minor trade routes. These islands have been well regarded for their high flower 
//density and their suitability for storing large quantities of cooking ingredients. While the cultists ignore the ingredients for the most part, their sole 
//goal seems to be to gather the flowers on the islands and sacrifice them to their vulgar gods, Cataclysmo, Apocalypsmo, and mow. Tired of all the 
//complaints he has been getting, King Meek decided to send his most useless kitchen hands, and the player, his most expendable 
//chef/commander. These kitchen hands have been given a crash course in knighthood but are far from adept. They have thus been granted the 
//title of ÅgNewly trained knightsÅh and then sent away to deal with this slight nuisance. Can you turn your band of Newly trained knights into a 
//powerful force to repel the sinister flower cultists and stop their aesthetic ruining ways? No. No you canÅ't.

<Tim>: I should not be awake this early. Why do I have to waste my time teaching you guys?;
<Chef>: I absolutely agree! We are already top caliber. We don't need any teaching!;
<Tim>: ...Sure. If that's what you believe. Regardless I still have to be here. King's orders.;
<Chef>: We shouldn't delay. Innocent flowers are dying every moment!;
<Tim>: ...because that's the issue here. Right.;
<Tim>: Let's get this over with. Start by moving towards that robot over there.;
<Chef>: Ah yes. I see the value in being next to the opponent. How do I do that?;
<Tim>: I thought you knew, Mr. Top Caliber.;
<Chef>: Er... I do! I just thought...You know...For the others!;
<Pierre>: Simply click on one of your units with the left mouse button to open up the action menu, then select the 'Move' action from the menu.; 
<Tim>: This costs one command point though!;
<Tim>: Don't worry about command points right now though. They'll be important later though.;
<Pierre>: Ahem. I guess I'll move up to the enemy then.;
<Tim>: Left click on a character, left click on the move action but RIGHT click on one of the blue tiles to move.;

<Pierre>: Whew, that was a long walk. It also seems we have run out of command points.;
<Tim>: You won't get any until the start of your next turn usually.;
<Pierre>: Command points are those symbols in the bottom right of the display.;
<Pierre>: Every action you take requires a command points.;
<Tim>: That's right, even if you move a single square, or your attack misses, that is one command point used.;
<Pierre>: When you are out of command points you can no longer take any actions.;
<Tim>: At this point it is time to end your turn and hope the enemy doesn't crush you too badly.;
<Chef>: I shall be the one doing the crushing! I have lots of experience. Garlic, nuts, bones... All sorts of things!;
<Tim>: Are any of those skills actually usable in a combat situation?;
<Chef>: Most definitely! Just not by me, or anyone else in this squad.;
<Pierre>: Banter aside, go ahead and end the turn. The opponent should only gently attack us, since this is training.;

<Pierre>: ARGGH! What setting are these things on?!;
<Tim>: Ahahaha! I was told you were top caliber! What's the matter?;
<Pierre>: Grr...Well I won't take that sitting down! Or standing up for that matter.;
<Chef>: I say, how rude! The customer is always right, Pierre.;
<Pierre>: I'm angry now, and he isn't any help. I'm going to hit this robot with all my might!;
<Tim>: You sure you want to do that? Do you know about type advantages?;
<Pierre>: Yeah! Fire beats grass, grass beats water, water beats fire and fairy beats dragon!;
<Tim>: No! Speed beats Attack, Attack beats Defense, Defense beats speed. Oh and everything beats healers like your leader.;
<Pierre>: That isn't reassuring. You, with the ladles, get over here and beat this thing up!;
<Tim>: You'll notice your command points are back. Go ahead and trash that thing, we have a lot of them.;
<Pierre>: Attacking is just like moving, except you must be standing next to them and a hit is not guaranteed.;
<Tim>: Exactly, open the action menu, right click on an enemy. Only healers can target allies though!;
<Pierre>: Well let's show this thing who the Masterchef is around here!;

<Pierre>: Is it... Is it dead? Phew!;
<Tim>: Well it's a pass. Barely.;
<Chef>: Did you expect anything less than a pass? Hahahaha...;
<Tim>: Yes. I hoped for it too.;
<Chef>: Now, onwards to battle! Those cultists won't subdue themselves!;
<Pierre>: I think I need a rest. A long rest.;
<Chef>: Oh, right. Did anyone find that mouse in the end? I thought I saw it for a moment but it was just one of Pierre's fingers.;
<Pieere>: Ohhh.... (Faints);
<Tim>: Time to leave, you can sleep on the boats.;
