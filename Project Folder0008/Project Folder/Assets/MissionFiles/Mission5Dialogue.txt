//Flower cultists have been attacking islands along King Meek's minor trade routes. These islands have been well regarded for their high flower 
//density and their suitability for storing large quantities of cooking ingredients. While the cultists ignore the ingredients for the most part, their sole 
//goal seems to be to gather the flowers on the islands and sacrifice them to their vulgar gods, Cataclysmo, Apocalypsmo, and mow. Tired of all the 
//complaints he has been getting, King Meek decided to send his most useless kitchen hands, and the player, his most expendable 
//chef/commander. These kitchen hands have been given a crash course in knighthood but are far from adept. They have thus been granted the 
//title of ÅgNewly trained knightsÅh and then sent away to deal with this slight nuisance. Can you turn your band of Newly trained knights into a 
//powerful force to repel the sinister flower cultists and stop their aesthetic ruining ways? No. No you canÅ't.

<Narrator>: The florist is attempting to flee, but the heroes have caught her before preparations were completed.;
<Chef>: There she is! We can't let her escape! She'll surely plague some other island if she does.;
<Pierre>: No use just chit chatting, men! Attack!;
<Chef>: How brave Pierre, usually you would be hiding by now!;
<Pierre>: We've nearly won, no point being a coward. It's just a little girl after all!;
<Ladlewight>: That isn't just a fluffy little girl. Just look at the fangs! And the bodies!;
<Chef>: Right, Pierre, lop her head off.;
<Pierre>: I'm on it, sir.;

<Chef>: Victory!;
<Pierre>: We won? We won! The wicked evil little girl is defeated!;
<Chef>: That is what one gets for defying the will of the king!;
<Pierre>: Sir, did we ever find out what happened to the villagers?;
<Chef>: Unfortunately we can only assume the worst. All the clues we have to go on are these signs, they say...;
<Sign>: Gone on vacation, be back later. Please take care of the garden.;
<Chef>: It's written in some foreign language though.;
<Pierre>: Yeah, there's nothing we can do but to take it back and hope someone else can read it.;
<Chef>: First we should scour this island for new ingredients though! Who knows what we will find?;
