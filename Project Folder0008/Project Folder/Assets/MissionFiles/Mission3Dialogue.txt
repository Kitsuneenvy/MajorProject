<Narrator>: The knights make it to the village where enemy reinforcements await them.;

<Chef>: I see that. They are right in front of us, after all.;
<Pierre>: ...Right. Sorry.;
<Chef>: Now, we need to protect the occupants of these houses!;
<Pierre>: They look more like ingredients than houses. I don't see anyone who would live here either.;
<Chef>: Let's make the enemy run first, then we can deal with the villagers.;
<Pierre>: Indeed! Defeating enough of them should make the rest of them run away.;

<Chef>: Victory is ours! Where are you going Pierre?;
<Pierre>: Oh, sorry. I saw people running away and I thought it was our side.;
<Chef>: We're knights now, victory or death! Unless it looks like we are losing.;
<Pierre>: Very inspirational sir. I think it is time to look for the villagers though.;
<Chef>: Don't worry about the villagers, the enemy is fleeing! Time to give chase and put an end to this menace.;
<Pierre>: Sir? Wait! Don't go off alone!;
