//Flower cultists have been attacking islands along King Meek's minor trade routes. These islands have been well regarded for their high flower 
//density and their suitability for storing large quantities of cooking ingredients. While the cultists ignore the ingredients for the most part, their sole 
//goal seems to be to gather the flowers on the islands and sacrifice them to their vulgar gods, Cataclysmo, Apocalypsmo, and mow. Tired of all the 
//complaints he has been getting, King Meek decided to send his most useless kitchen hands, and the player, his most expendable 
//chef/commander. These kitchen hands have been given a crash course in knighthood but are far from adept. They have thus been granted the 
//title of ÅgNewly trained knightsÅh and then sent away to deal with this slight nuisance. Can you turn your band of Newly trained knights into a 
//powerful force to repel the sinister flower cultists and stop their aesthetic ruining ways? No. No you canÅ't.

<Narrator>: The knights make it to the village where enemy reinforcements await them.;
<Pierre>: Sir! Enemy reinforcements are waiting for us!;
<Chef>: I see that. They are right in front of us, after all.;
<Pierre>: ...Right. Sorry.;
<Chef>: Now, we need to protect the occupants of these houses!;
<Pierre>: They look more like ingredients than houses. I don't see anyone who would live here either.;
<Chef>: Let's make the enemy run first, then we can deal with the villagers.;
<Pierre>: Indeed! Defeating enough of them should make the rest of them run away.;

<Pierre>: That little girl seems to be their leader. She also seems to reinvigorate the cultists with her watering can.;
<Chef>: Eliminating her first will make our job easier.;

<Chef>: Victory is ours! Where are you going Pierre?;
<Pierre>: Oh, sorry. I saw people running away and I thought it was our side.;
<Chef>: We're knights now, victory or death! Unless it looks like we are losing.;
<Pierre>: Very inspirational sir. I think it is time to look for the villagers though.;
<Chef>: Don't worry about the villagers, the enemy is fleeing! Time to give chase and put an end to this menace.;
<Pierre>: Sir? Wait! Don't go off alone!;
