//Flower cultists have been attacking islands along King Meek's minor trade routes. These islands have been well regarded for their high flower 
//density and their suitability for storing large quantities of cooking ingredients. While the cultists ignore the ingredients for the most part, their sole 
//goal seems to be to gather the flowers on the islands and sacrifice them to their vulgar gods, Cataclysmo, Apocalypsmo, and mow. Tired of all the 
//complaints he has been getting, King Meek decided to send his most useless kitchen hands, and the player, his most expendable 
//chef/commander. These kitchen hands have been given a crash course in knighthood but are far from adept. They have thus been granted the 
//title of ÅgNewly trained knightsÅh and then sent away to deal with this slight nuisance. Can you turn your band of Newly trained knights into a 
//powerful force to repel the sinister flower cultists and stop their aesthetic ruining ways? No. No you canÅ't.

<Narrator>: The commander has been seperated from his forces after chasing the fleeing enemy, right into another ambush.;
<Chef>: This does not bode well. It appears I have been surrounded. HEEEELP MEEE! Someone? Anyone? Your leader is in trouble!;
<Pierre>: *Sigh* I warned him. Well looks like we have to save him. The enemy is focused on him so we can jus-;
<Chef>: Woe is me! Is this where I am to meet my end?;
<Ladlewight>: I'm on my way sir, just sit tight.;
<Pierre>: If we manage to repel the enemy for long enough they should give up, their main force has already routed.;
<Chef>: Still in trouble over here Pierre. Whenever you're done talking to yourself could you lend a hand?;
<Pierre>: Oh! Right away.;

<Chef>: Just protect me for a few rounds of combat and then we will give chase to their leader.;
<Pierre>: We are still awaiting the rest of our force after your... er...'Charge', sir.;
<Chef>: Those fools! Half rations for dinner tonight.;
<Pierre>: Half rations?!;
<Chef>: If they don't want to keep up, they obviously don't need all that energy. I think I'll take extra.;
<Pierre>: You are a cruel man, sir.;

<Chef>: Ah hah! Pierre, answer me this, what is the flight velocity of an unladen swallow?;
<Pierre>: Europian or American, sir?;
<Chef>: I don't know that. But whichever it is, it still isn't as fast as these cowards flee!;
<Pierre>: Quite right, sir. We still have to give chase, however.;
<Chef>: Let's get to it then, I do believe they are still loading their ships for departure.;
<Pierre>: As we all know, the target is always the last to get on the escape vehicle.;
<Chef>: Correct! In fact I think that is her there!;
<Pierre>: Well that didn't take long.;
<Chef>: Everyone! Kill the little girl!;
