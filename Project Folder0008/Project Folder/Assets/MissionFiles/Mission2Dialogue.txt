//Flower cultists have been attacking islands along King Meek's minor trade routes. These islands have been well regarded for their high flower 
//density and their suitability for storing large quantities of cooking ingredients. While the cultists ignore the ingredients for the most part, their sole 
//goal seems to be to gather the flowers on the islands and sacrifice them to their vulgar gods, Cataclysmo, Apocalypsmo, and mow. Tired of all the 
//complaints he has been getting, King Meek decided to send his most useless kitchen hands, and the player, his most expendable 
//chef/commander. These kitchen hands have been given a crash course in knighthood but are far from adept. They have thus been granted the 
//title of ÅgNewly trained knightsÅh and then sent away to deal with this slight nuisance. Can you turn your band of Newly trained knights into a 
//powerful force to repel the sinister flower cultists and stop their aesthetic ruining ways? No. No you canÅ't.

<Narrator>: The newly trained knights make their way through the ravine, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead.;
<Pierre>: Oh dear, I hope there are no dangers lying ahead.;
<Chef>: I hope so too, but there is no way to know for sure. We'll advance regardless!;
<Pierre>: Slow down, you're going too fast!;
<Chef>: Nonsense, you're just too slow! We have to make it to the village as quickly as possible!;
<Pierre>: I want to make it to the village in one piece at least.;
<Chef>: Quit your nagging.;
<Ladlewight>: Ahem. More cultists up ahead. You guys should stop hitting each other and start hitting them instead.;
<Chef>: Erm...Quite. Carry on then, to battle!;

<Pierre>: Sir, there is a little girl on the battlefield!;
<Chef>: Indeed, I see her over there. We can't have that! Kill her, quickly.;
<Pierre>: Um, sir? Shouldn't we save her, not harm her?;
<Chef>: Ridiculous. She is obviously a demon, look at the way her eyes glow and how she hovers above the ground.;
<Pierre>: Goodness, you're right! She must be one of the cultists. How terrible.;
<Chef>: For now, our objective is to reach the other side of the ravine, fighting in this narrow space is too dangerous.;

<Chef>: Okay, leave the enemies for now! Get to the village, we'll hold them off there.;

<Chef>: Calm down Pierre, this is a tactical advancement.;
